Nimilau: a collaborative Pidgin

**Nimilau** (*our language*, also called **Milauni'o**, **Globamilau** and **Glossani**) is a pidgin that was born in a Discord server managed by u/Superiorform over the past 9 days. There was and still is a singular rule: never use English. Nimilau was created organically by native speakers of Mandarin, Russian, Japanese, Italian, French, Spanish, and others I don't even remember, as they struggled to build a mean to communicate. The language has developed extremely fast to the point that we are now able to hold a conversation; due to timezone differences it has split into two main dialects that are barely mutually intelligible (**Eurodialectu** and **Asiadialectu**), with still considerable variation within.

A short excerpt of the current look of Nimilau in the way *I* speak it (branch of Eurodialectu):

*Salovi agora! Kalimorno. Mita etadyau zai mornoxiwu vartabervik? Niko sole mumuvoda vartabermik, sirxia idumi ogar slapenu. Da, jixmik mita telos mujinarak mumuvoda neyao. Tredobro por mi. Maar se wollenmik mumuvodataber, idumik si taber, mit u nemit eta mujinara mita milaomi mita ne si taber. Mi'o fikrva stentovik?*

No translation (as it would be a forbidden mixture with English) and no IPA since Nimilau is only a written language. (If I get an asiadialectu speaker to donate a passage too I'll edit it in).

Grammatically it's a beautiful disaster. Depending on the dialect it's somewhere between fully analytic and agglutinating. The european dialect agglutinates more generously, with the longest compound I can tell you off the top of my mind being *mujinamakvamilaumilao*, in morphemes *mujina'mak'va'mila'u'mila'o*, meaning (forgive me *one* translation) *to speak a conlang*. It's also somewhat ergative, which derived from an older tripartite experiment, which in turn was in reaction to the difficulty of identifying arguments in the essentially free word order that to date has refused to stabilise. The asian dialect I have only a partial understanding of but is more faithful to the original analytic typology. An interesting trivia is that at a certain point we figured out that Asiadialectu and Eurodialectu marked possessives with the same preposition(s), but backwards, with Euro marking possessor and Asia the possessed. That led to a confusing exchange and now it's shifted to using a different genitive suffix to bypass this headache.

The language is continuous evolution. Not only are words added, eroded, contracted, and used for derivation, but grammatical features grow, mutate, and disappear. If you think you would like to participate in this wonderful project please come visit us on Discord: https://discord.gg/uUt6U7w - we'll get you up and running on learning Nimilau as it stands now and you'll help continuing to grow the language.
